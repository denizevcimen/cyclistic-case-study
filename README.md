# cyclistic-case-study

This is a case study in the Capstone Projects Course which is the last step of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

## Scenario:

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. 

The company has 3 pricing plans which these are:
- Single-ride passes
- Full-day passes
- Annual memberships.
  - Customers who purchase *single-ride* or *full-day passes* are referred to as **casual riders**. 
  - Customers who purchase *annual* memberships are **Cyclistic members**. 


In this case study I prefer to use Spreadsheet, R, and Google Slides. Unfortunately, company data was too big for the Spreadsheet so I decided to choose a sample dataset and work on it. The dataset has % 98 confidence level and %2 merges of error level. Sample sizes are chosen depending on Sample Size Calculator Sheet shared to course content. 

You will find the original datasets, sample sizes dataset and the R codes in files.
